# Path of Exile Helpers

This module bundles local helper utilities for PoE. Drop your `zone_changer` and `graph_tracker` projects under `/home/wps/` (or set `ZONE_CHANGER_DIR` / `GRAPH_TRACKER_DIR` when running).

Provided scripts:
- `verify-prereqs.sh` ensures both projects exist before execution.
- `launch-zone-changer.sh` runs the zone watcher python script.
- `launch-graph-tracker.sh` launches the tracker wrapper script.

Adjust the environment variables if you relocate the projects.
